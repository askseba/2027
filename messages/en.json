Practical example: If you're sensitive to synthetic oud, we automatically exclude all fragrances containing it. But we may suggest fragrances with 100% natural oud wood if they're safe for you. How do we analyze your sensitivity? Note type (natural vs. synthetic), precise chemical components, potential reactions with your skin. ⚠️ Important: If you develop a new severe allergy, consult a dermatologist first!"

Do the main notes (Heart & Base) match your taste? 2️⃣ Health safety (40%): Is the fragrance completely free of your personal allergens? Does it comply with IFRA safety standards? 3️⃣ Lifestyle fit (20%): Does it suit your region's climate? Is it appropriate for the occasions you specified (daily, evening, formal...)? Why might the score be 87% and not 100%? A 100% score means perfect match in everything, which is very rare. Because we're honest with you! 💡 Tip: Any fragrance at 85%+ is an excellent choice!"

Sensitivities may: 📈 Develop: A new allergy appears that wasn't there before, 📉 Subside: An old allergy disappears with treatment or lifestyle changes, 🔄 Change: Become less or more severe. 💡 Solution: You can retake the quiz periodically or when buying a new fragrance or checking one you own."
